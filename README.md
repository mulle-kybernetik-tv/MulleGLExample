## Build

This is a [mulle-sde](https://mulle-sde.github.io/) project.

It has it's own virtual environment, that will be automatically setup for you
once you enter it with:

```
mulle-sde MulleGLExample
```

Now you can let **mulle-sde** fetch the required dependencies and build the 
project for you:

```
mulle-sde craft
```
